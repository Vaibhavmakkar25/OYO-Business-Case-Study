This repository hosts the solutions for Oyo business room sales analysis.  

I used various SQL functions such as :          
 Case When Statements           
 CTE           
 Joins           
 Logical Operator          
 Group by, Order by, Where         
 Aggregate functions Sum, Count, Average                
 Date functions Datename, Datediff, Month           
          
Insights:-

1. Banglore , gurgaon & delhi were popular in the bookings, whereas Kolkata is less popular in bookings

2. Nature of Bookings:         
       
      • Nearly 50 % of the bookings were made on the day of check in only.       
      • Nearly 85 % of the bookings were made with less than 4 days prior to the date of check in.    
      • Very few no.of bookings were made in advance(i.e over a 1 month or 2 months).      
      • Most of the bookings involved only a single room.    
      • Nearly 80% of the bookings involved a stay of 1 night only.     
           
3. Oyo should acquire more hotels in the cities of Pune, Kolkata & Mumbai. Because their average room rates are comparetively higher so more revenue will come.         
     
4. The % cancellation Rate is high on all 9 cities except pune , so Oyo should focus on finding reasons about cancellation.
